jqGrid is a popular jQuery Plugin for displaying and editing data in tabular form. It has some other more sophisticated features, like subgrids, TreeGrids, grouping and so on.

jqGrid was developed mostly by [Tony Tomov](https://github.com/tonytomov) in the past and it was available under MIT/GPL-licenses till the version 4.7.0 published Dec 8, 2014 (see [here](https://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid/tree/v4.7.0)). Short time after that the license agreement was changed (see <a href="https://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid/commit/1b2cb55c93ee8b279f15a3faf5a2f82a98da3b4c">here</a>) and new 4.7.1 version was <a href="https://github.com/tonytomov/jqGrid/tree/v4.7.1">published</a>.

The code from the GitHib repository is the fork of jqGrid 4.7.0 - the latest version available under MIT/GPL-licenses. It will be provided under MIT/GPL-licenses.

Below you can find short description of minor new features and the bug fixes implemented in free jqGrid 4.13.3 (compared with version 4.13.2). The version is developed by [Oleg Kiriljuk](https://github.com/OlegKi), alias [Oleg](http://stackoverflow.com/users/315935/oleg) on the stackoverflow and [OlegK](http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=393) on trirand forum.

Read [Wiki](https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/wiki) for more detailed information about the features of free-jqGrid. The preliminary version of the documentation can be found [here](http://free-jqgrid.github.io/).

Free jqGrid can be used *for free*. We still ask to contribute the development by donating via PayPal, if one have the possibility for it. One can donate by clicking on the following button [![PayPayl donate button](https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/en_US/btn/btn_donate_pp_142x27.png)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=JGTCBLQM2BYHG "Donate once-off to free jqGrid project using PayPal") or by sending money via PayPal to oleg.kiriljuk@ok-soft-gmbh.com with the comment "free jqGrid". Bank transfer based on the invoice from OK soft GmbH is another option of donating. Just send the email with the information about the amount of donation and you will get the corresponding invoice with the full information about our bank account and our VAT number.

One can install the package with respect of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/free-jqgrid) by using "npm install free-jqgrid", with respect of [bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=free-jqgrid) by using "bower install free-jqgrid" or from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/free-jqGrid) by using "Install-Package free-jqGrid".

The package is published on [WebJars](http://www.webjars.org/) too and it's deployed to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cfree-jqgrid).

Free jqGrid is is available from [jsDelivr CDN](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!free-jqgrid) and [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/free-jqgrid). Thus one can use it directly from Internet by including for example the URLs like
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/free-jqgrid/4.13.3/css/ui.jqgrid.min.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/free-jqgrid/4.13.3/js/i18n/grid.locale-de.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/free-jqgrid/4.13.3/js/jquery.jqgrid.min.js"></script>
```
or
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/free-jqgrid/4.13.3/css/ui.jqgrid.min.css">
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/free-jqgrid/4.13.3/js/i18n/grid.locale-de.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/free-jqgrid/4.13.3/js/jquery.jqgrid.min.js"></script>
```
**The locale file is optional**. One can, but one don't need to include `grid.locale-en.min.js`, because the same information is already included in the `jquery.jqgrid.min.js` (or `jquery.jqgrid.src.js`).

If somebody want to test the *latest* version of free jqGrid, one can load it directly from GitHib using [RawGit](http://rawgit.com/) service:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rawgit.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/master/css/ui.jqgrid.css">
<script src="https://rawgit.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/master/js/i18n/grid.locale-de.js"></script>
<script src="https://rawgit.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/master/js/jquery.jqgrid.src.js"></script>
```
All other language files and plugins are available from CDN too. See [the wiki article](https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/wiki/Access-free-jqGrid-from-different-CDNs) for more details about the usage of free jqGrid from CDNs and RawGit.

Remark: the above URLs will be available **after publishing** the release of the version of 4.13.3.

### Below one can see the full list of changes in the version 4.13.3 compared with 4.13.2:

* Bug fix in `filterToolbar` in case of usage legacy (`stringResult: false`) searching mode.
* Bug fix makes `setGroupHeaders` correct working if the grid is inside of hidden div (for example, inactive jQuery UI Tab).
* Extending `newGroup` parameter of `summaryType` of data grouping. The property `keys` is added to `newGroup` parameter of the callback function `summaryType` of grouping. See [the issue](https://github.com/free-jqgrid/jqGrid/issues/227) for more details.
* Bug fix of `showHideCol` to correctly process working with multiple grids.
* Improve the compatibility to old jqGrid in processing of XML input data which has no `id` attributes.
* Bug fix in CSS of legacy/simplified subgrids.
* Bug fix in highlighting of selected cells during cell editing.
* Add new `displayErrorMessage` method, which simplifies placing custom error information in the error div.
* Add support of frozen columns in `columnChooser`, `remapColumns`, `showCol`, `hideCol`, `showHideCol`. One can use `notSkipFrozen: true` to allow hiding/showing frozen columns. For example, `$(this).jqGrid("columnChooser", {notSkipFrozen: true});`.
* Bug fix in `sortableRows`. The bug exist in all free jqGrid in versions between version 4.10.0 and 4.13.2.
* Add callback function `summaryFormat` to `colModel` items. The callback will be used in grouping data.
