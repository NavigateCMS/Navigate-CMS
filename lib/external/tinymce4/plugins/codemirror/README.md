This plugin offers the following functionality:

- Syntax highlighting of HTML, Javascript and PHP code
- Line numbers
- Highlighting the line currently being edited
- Automatic indentation
- Many undo/redo levels
- Search/Replace functionality
- Etc. etc.

Installation
------------

1. Download and install TinyMCE 4 and make sure it runs correctly with default settings.
2. Download this repository found at https://github.com/christiaan/tinymce-codemirror
3. Place the directory `plugins/codemirror` in the `tinymce/plugins` directory.
4. Download CodeMirror (version 4 or later) from http://codemirror.net/codemirror-latest.zip.
5. Unpack codemirror-latest.zip inside the plugins/codemirror folder that was
   just created. A folder named codemirror-4.8 (or similar) will be created.
6. Activate the codemirror plugin in TinyMCE:

    plugins: ['codemirror']

7. Optionally, add the code button to TinyMCEâ€™s toolbar:

    toolbar: 'undo redo | styleselect | bold italic | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | bullist numlist outdent indent | code'

8. Test: You should see a Source code item in the Tools menu. Click it to edit
   the HTML source code.

Configuration
-------------
Additional configuration options

You can modify the behaviour of the codemirror plugin, by adding a codemirror
object to the TinyMCE configuration.

**indentOnInit**: boolean (false) CodeMirror automatically indents code. With
the indentOnInit option, you tell the Source Code editor to indent all code when
the editor opens. This might be slow for large documents.

**path**: string (codemirror) You might already have CodeMirror hosted elsewhere
(outside TinyMCE). In that case, you can reuse that CodeMirror instance, by
overriding the default path. For example:

    path: 'http://www.mysite.com/tools/codemirror-4.8'

**config**: Object CodeMirror configuration object, which is passed on to the
CodeMirror instance. Check http://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html for available
configuration options.

**jsFiles**: Array Array of CodeMirror Javascript files you want to
(additionally) load. For example:

    jsFiles: [
       'mode/clike/clike.js',
       'mode/php/php.js'
    ]

The following Javascript files are always loaded: lib/codemirror.js,
addon/edit/matchbrackets.js, mode/xml/xml.js, mode/javascript/javascript.js,
mode/css/css.js, mode/htmlmixed/htmlmixed.js, addon/dialog/dialog.js,
addon/search/searchcursor.js, addon/search/search.js,
addon/selection/active-line.js.


**cssFiles**: Array Array of CodeMirror CSS files you want to (additionally)
load. For example:

    cssFiles: [
       'theme/neat.css',
       'theme/elegant.css'
    ]

The following CSS files are always loaded: lib/codemirror.css,
addon/dialog/dialog.css.

Config example

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: '#html',
  plugins: 'codemirror',
  toolbar: 'undo redo | styleselect | bold italic | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | bullist numlist outdent indent | code',
  codemirror: {
    indentOnInit: true, // Whether or not to indent code on init.
    path: 'CodeMirror', // Path to CodeMirror distribution
    config: {           // CodeMirror config object
       mode: 'application/x-httpd-php',
       lineNumbers: false
    },
    jsFiles: [          // Additional JS files to load
       'mode/clike/clike.js',
       'mode/php/php.js'
    ]
  }
});
```

Compatibility
-------------

This TinyMCE plugin is compatible with pretty much all browsers out there,
including Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer, version 8 or
better. It is NOT compatible with Interner Explorer 6 or 7, simply because
CodeMirror itself does not work in these versions.
